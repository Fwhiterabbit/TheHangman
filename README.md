Deplyed Site Here: [The Hangman](https://fwhiterabbit.github.io/TheHangman/)

The Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game is usually played on paper or a board. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman's figure being drawn. The player has six chances to guess the word correctly before the hangman's figure is completed, which would mean game over. Each correct letter guessed is placed in its correct position in the word, and incorrect guesses bring the player closer to being "hanged." The objective is to guess the word correctly before running out of chances.

The Hangman has 2 categories mixed together:
*  TV Shows
*  Gaming

# User Experience
* I want it to be easy to navigate
* I want to know if letter i chose is correct or not
* I want to know how many times i guessed it wrong
* I want to see hidden word after game finish
* I want my website to be playable on PC and Small screens ( phones )
---
# Design
I used Paint to draw simple platform where man will be hanged, or maybe not . Each time guess is wrong another line will be drawn.
